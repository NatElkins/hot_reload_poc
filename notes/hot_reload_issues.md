# F# Hot Reload Implementation Issues

## Overview

This document outlines the key differences and issues between the current F# hot reload implementation and Roslyn's implementation. The goal is to identify what needs to be fixed to make the F# implementation work correctly.

## 1. Delta Format and Structure

### Current F# Implementation
```fsharp
type Delta = {
    MetadataDelta: byte[]
    ILDelta: byte[]
    PdbDelta: byte[]
}
```

### Roslyn Implementation
```csharp
public readonly struct Update
{
    public Guid ModuleId { get; }
    public ImmutableArray<byte> ILDelta { get; }
    public ImmutableArray<byte> MetadataDelta { get; }
    public ImmutableArray<byte> PdbDelta { get; }
    public ImmutableArray<int> UpdatedMethods { get; }
    public ImmutableArray<int> UpdatedTypes { get; }
}
```

### Key Issues
1. Missing `ModuleId` - The F# implementation doesn't track which module is being updated
2. Missing `UpdatedMethods` and `UpdatedTypes` - These are crucial for the runtime to know which methods/types to update
3. Using `byte[]` instead of `ImmutableArray<byte>` - This is less efficient and doesn't match the expected format

## 2. Metadata Delta Generation

### Current Implementation Issues
1. Only tracks table row count changes, not actual content changes
2. Doesn't handle metadata stream changes (#Strings, #Blob, #GUID, #US)
3. Doesn't preserve token mappings
4. Doesn't handle type system changes properly
5. Doesn't follow the PE file format structure for metadata deltas

## 3. IL Delta Generation

### Current Implementation Issues
1. Only tracks RVA changes, not actual IL content
2. Doesn't include method headers (flags, maxstack, codesize, etc.)
3. Doesn't handle exception handling clauses
4. Doesn't preserve local variable signatures
5. Doesn't follow the CIL format for method body changes

## 4. PDB Delta Generation

### Current Implementation Issues
1. Only handles sequence points, not other debug information
2. Doesn't handle document table changes
3. Doesn't handle local scope information
4. Doesn't follow the Portable PDB format
5. Doesn't preserve debug information mappings

## 5. Overall Architecture

### Missing Components
1. No proper symbol matching and remapping
2. No proper token preservation
3. No proper state tracking
4. No proper error handling and diagnostics
5. No proper integration with the runtime's hot reload infrastructure

## Required Fixes

To make the implementation work correctly, we need to:

1. Implement proper symbol matching and remapping
2. Generate correct metadata, IL, and PDB deltas that follow the proper formats
3. Add proper state tracking and preservation
4. Add proper error handling and diagnostics
5. Integrate properly with the runtime's hot reload infrastructure

## Next Steps

1. Create a minimal proof of concept that can handle a single, simple change
2. Implement proper delta format matching Roslyn's structure
3. Add basic symbol matching and token preservation
4. Add proper error handling
5. Test with simple scenarios before expanding to more complex cases
