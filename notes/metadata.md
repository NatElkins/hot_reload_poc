Okay, here is an extremely detailed document on constructing CLI metadata tables, drawing heavily from the provided ECMA-335 standard document (specifically, the OCR of Partition II). This aims to be comprehensive enough to serve as an implementation specification, keeping in mind the potential use case for hot reload scenarios where understanding deltas and precise structure is critical.

**Constructing Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) Metadata Tables**

**Based on ECMA-335 6th Edition (June 2012)**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Target Audience:** Implementers of CLI tooling, compilers, runtimes, and features like hot reload.

**1. Introduction**

The Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) relies heavily on metadata to describe types, members, assemblies, and other constructs. This metadata enables features like reflection, late binding, code verification, garbage collection, and cross-language interoperability. Metadata is stored in a structured, binary format within CLI-compliant modules (typically PE/COFF files).

This document provides a highly detailed specification for the *logical structure* and *physical layout* of these metadata tables and their supporting heaps, primarily based on Partition II of the ECMA-335 standard. It aims to provide sufficient byte-level detail for implementers to correctly read, interpret, construct, and potentially modify these structures. Understanding this structure is crucial for tasks such as compilation, decompilation, code analysis, and advanced runtime services like hot reloading.

**2. Core Metadata Concepts**

Before diving into individual tables, several fundamental concepts must be understood:

**2.1. Metadata Storage: Streams**

Metadata is not stored directly as tables in the final PE file. Instead, it's organized into several *streams* within a dedicated section of the PE file. Key streams include:

1.  **`#~` Stream (Compressed Metadata Tables):** Contains the rows for the various metadata tables themselves. This stream is often compressed, omitting empty tables and optimizing index sizes. (§II.24.2.6)
2.  **`#Strings` Heap:** Stores null-terminated UTF-8 encoded strings referenced by metadata tables. (§II.24.2.3)
3.  **`#US` Heap (User Strings):** Stores user-defined literal strings, typically used by the `ldstr` CIL instruction. These are stored as UTF-16 encoded strings, prefixed by their length, and include an additional terminal byte indicating the presence of high-frequency Unicode characters. (§II.24.2.4)
4.  **`#Blob` Heap (Binary Large Objects):** Stores unstructured binary data, primarily method signatures, field signatures, type specifications, and other variable-length data items referenced by metadata tables. (§II.24.2.4)
5.  **`#GUID` Heap:** Stores 16-byte Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), indexed starting from 1. (§II.24.2.5)

**2.2. Metadata Tokens**

Metadata tokens are 4-byte values used within CIL instructions and other metadata structures to reference specific rows in metadata tables or offsets within heaps.

*   **Structure:** A metadata token is composed of:
    *   **Table Index (Top Byte):** Identifies the metadata table (e.g., `0x02` for `TypeDef`, `0x06` for `MethodDef`).
    *   **Record Index (RID - Lower 3 Bytes):** A 1-based index indicating the specific row within the identified table.
*   **Example:** A token `0x02000007` refers to row 7 in the `TypeDef` table (Table Index `0x02`).
*   **Null References:** A token with a RID of 0 represents a null reference (i.e., it doesn't point to any valid row).
*   **User String Tokens:** Tokens referencing the `#US` heap have a specific "Table Index" byte (`0x70`) and the lower 3 bytes represent the 0-based byte offset into the `#US` heap.

**2.3. Metadata Heaps - Detailed Structure**

*   **`#Strings` Heap:**
    *   A sequence of null-terminated UTF-8 strings.
    *   Indices are 0-based byte offsets into the heap.
    *   The first entry (index 0) is always the empty string (`\0`).
    *   Can contain unreachable "garbage" strings.
*   **`#US` Heap:**
    *   A sequence of user string blobs.
    *   Indices are 0-based byte offsets into the heap.
    *   The first entry (index 0) is the "empty blob" (single byte `0x00`).
    *   Each string blob is encoded as:
        *   **Length:** Compressed unsigned integer (§II.23.2) indicating the number of *bytes* (not characters) that follow. The length must be odd or zero.
        *   **Characters:** UTF-16 encoded characters comprising the string.
        *   **Terminal Byte:** An additional byte with value `0x01` if any character has non-zero bits in its high byte or if its low byte is one of `0x01-0x08`, `0x0E-0x1F`, `0x27`, `0x2D`, `0x7F`; otherwise, the terminal byte is `0x00`.
*   **`#Blob` Heap:**
    *   A sequence of binary data blobs.
    *   Indices are 0-based byte offsets into the heap.
    *   The first entry (index 0) is the "empty blob" (single byte `0x00`).
    *   Each blob is encoded as:
        *   **Length:** Compressed unsigned integer (§II.23.2) indicating the number of bytes that follow.
        *   **Data:** The raw binary data of the blob (e.g., method signatures).
*   **`#GUID` Heap:**
    *   A sequence of 16-byte GUIDs.
    *   Indices are 1-based (index 1 refers to the first GUID).
    *   Can contain unreachable "garbage" GUIDs.

**2.4. Signatures (Stored in #Blob Heap)**

Signatures are binary encodings for the types of fields, methods, local variables, etc. They are crucial for type safety, reflection, and method binding. All signatures are stored as blobs in the `#Blob` heap.

*   **Integer Compression:** Signatures heavily use integer compression to save space. Unsigned integers are compressed as described in §II.23.2 (1, 2, or 4 bytes depending on value).
*   **Element Type Constants:** Signatures use single-byte constants (defined in §II.23.1.16) to represent primitive types (`ELEMENT_TYPE_I4`, `ELEMENT_TYPE_STRING`, `ELEMENT_TYPE_CLASS`, etc.) and type modifiers (`ELEMENT_TYPE_PTR`, `ELEMENT_TYPE_BYREF`, `ELEMENT_TYPE_SZARRAY`, etc.).
*   **Token Encoding:** References to `TypeDef`, `TypeRef`, or `TypeSpec` tables within signatures often use the compact `TypeDefOrRefOrSpecEncoded` format (§II.23.2.8).
*   **Common Signature Types:** (See §II.23.2 for detailed syntax diagrams)
    *   **`FieldSig` (§II.23.2.4):** Starts with `FIELD` (0x06), followed by optional custom modifiers (`CustomMod`), followed by the field's `Type`.
    *   **`MethodDefSig` (§II.23.2.1):** Encodes a method definition's signature.
        *   Starts with a calling convention byte (combining `HASTHIS`, `EXPLICITTHIS`, `DEFAULT`/`VARARG`/`GENERIC`).
        *   If generic (`GENERIC` bit set), followed by the compressed `GenParamCount`.
        *   Followed by the compressed `ParamCount` (total parameters, excluding return type).
        *   Followed by the `RetType` (return type).
        *   Followed by `ParamCount` occurrences of `Param` (parameter types).
    *   **`MethodRefSig` (§II.23.2.2):** Encodes a call-site signature. Identical to `MethodDefSig` for non-vararg methods. For vararg methods, it includes a `SENTINEL` marker (0x41) followed by types for the variable arguments.
    *   **`StandAloneMethodSig` (§II.23.2.3):** Used for `calli`. Similar to `MethodRefSig` but allows unmanaged calling conventions (`C`, `STDCALL`, etc.).
    *   **`PropertySig` (§II.23.2.5):** Encodes a property's signature (essentially the getter's signature). Starts with `PROPERTY` (0x08) + `HASTHIS` (if instance property). Followed by `ParamCount` (number of indexer parameters), the property `Type`, and `ParamCount` occurrences of `Param` (indexer parameter types).
    *   **`LocalVarSig` (§II.23.2.6):** Encodes the types of local variables in a method. Starts with `LOCAL_SIG` (0x07). Followed by `Count` (number of locals), followed by `Count` occurrences of type information (optional `Constraint` (`PINNED`), optional custom modifiers (`CustomMod`), and the `Type`).
    *   **`TypeSpec` (§II.23.2.14):** Encodes complex type references (arrays, pointers, generic instantiations) stored in the `TypeSpec` table.

**2.5. Coded Indices**

To save space, certain index columns in metadata tables don't point to a single table but can point to one of several tables. These are called *coded indices*. A few bits of the stored index value are used to encode *which* table is being targeted, and the remaining bits encode the 1-based row index within that target table.

*   **Encoding:** The number of bits needed for the tag depends on the number of possible target tables (n). The tag uses `log2(n)` bits (rounded up). The final stored value is `(RID << log2(n)) | tag`.
*   **Decoding:** Requires masking off the tag bits and then shifting the RID bits right.
*   **Common Coded Indices (§II.24.2.6):**
    *   `TypeDefOrRef`: 2 tag bits; targets `TypeDef` (0), `TypeRef` (1), `TypeSpec` (2).
    *   `HasConstant`: 2 tag bits; targets `Field` (0), `Param` (1), `Property` (2).
    *   `HasCustomAttribute`: 5 tag bits; targets numerous tables (see §II.24.2.6 for the full list).
    *   `HasFieldMarshall`: 1 tag bit; targets `Field` (0), `Param` (1).
    *   `HasDeclSecurity`: 2 tag bits; targets `TypeDef` (0), `MethodDef` (1), `Assembly` (2).
    *   `MemberRefParent`: 3 tag bits; targets `TypeDef` (0), `TypeRef` (1), `ModuleRef` (2), `MethodDef` (3), `TypeSpec` (4).
    *   `HasSemantics`: 1 tag bit; targets `Event` (0), `Property` (1).
    *   `MethodDefOrRef`: 1 tag bit; targets `MethodDef` (0), `MemberRef` (1).
    *   `MemberForwarded`: 1 tag bit; targets `Field` (0), `MethodDef` (1).
    *   `Implementation`: 2 tag bits; targets `File` (0), `AssemblyRef` (1), `ExportedType` (2).
    *   `CustomAttributeType`: 3 tag bits; targets `MethodDef` (2), `MemberRef` (3). (Values 0, 1, 4 are unused).
    *   `ResolutionScope`: 2 tag bits; targets `Module` (0), `ModuleRef` (1), `AssemblyRef` (2), `TypeRef` (3).
    *   `TypeOrMethodDef`: 1 tag bit; targets `TypeDef` (0), `MethodDef` (1).

**2.6. Index Sizes and the `#~` Stream Header**

The physical size of index columns (2 bytes or 4 bytes) is determined per-module based on the maximum number of rows in the target table(s) or the size of the target heap. This is controlled by the `HeapSizes` byte in the `#~` stream header (§II.24.2.6).

*   **`HeapSizes` byte:**
    *   Bit 0 set: Indices into the `#Strings` heap are 4 bytes wide.
    *   Bit 1 set: Indices into the `#GUID` heap are 4 bytes wide.
    *   Bit 2 set: Indices into the `#Blob` heap are 4 bytes wide.
    *   If a bit is clear, the corresponding indices are 2 bytes wide.
*   **Table Index Sizes:**
    *   Simple indices into table *i*: 2 bytes if table *i* has < 2^16 rows; 4 bytes otherwise.
    *   Coded indices targeting tables *t0...tn-1*: 2 bytes if the maximum row count across all target tables is < 2^(16 - log2(n)); 4 bytes otherwise.

**3. Metadata Physical Layout (§II.24)**

This section details how the logical streams and tables are physically arranged in a PE file.

**3.1. Metadata Root (§II.24.2.1)**

The starting point for finding metadata within the PE file. Located via the CLI Header's `MetaData` directory entry (§II.25.3.3).

| Offset | Size | Field         | Description                                                                |

**4. Metadata Table Definitions (§II.22)**

This is the core section detailing each table's structure. For each table, the columns are listed with their type and meaning. **Index sizes (2 or 4 bytes) are determined by the `HeapSizes` flags and target table row counts as described in §2.6.** Validation rules ([ERROR], [WARNING], [CLS]) are critical for correctness.

*(Note: Due to the extreme length required to detail every single table byte-for-byte with all validation rules as requested, I will provide a highly detailed example for a few key tables and summarize the others. A full implementation would require systematically applying this level of detail to *all* tables listed in §II.22.2 through §II.22.39 based *directly* on the standard's text.)*

**4.1. Example: `Module` Table (0x00)**

*   **Purpose:** Holds information about the current module.
*   **Columns:**
    1.  **`Generation` (2-byte constant):** Reserved, should be zero. Used for EnC (Edit and Continue).
    2.  **`Name` (index into #Strings heap):** The name of the module (e.g., "MyLibrary.dll"). The name should match the `ModuleRef.Name` of any references to this module. [ERROR] Must index a non-empty string. [ERROR]
    3.  **`Mvid` (index into #GUID heap):** Module Version ID. Unique identifier for this version of the module. Should be generated anew for each build (§II.22.30). Must index a non-null GUID. [ERROR]
    4.  **`EncId` (index into #GUID heap):** Reserved, should be zero. Used for EnC.
    5.  **`EncBaseId` (index into #GUID heap):** Reserved, should be zero. Used for EnC.
*   **Validation:**
    *   Must contain exactly one row. [ERROR]

*   **Validation:**
    *   `ResolutionScope` must be valid as per rules in §II.22.38 (e.g., cannot be `Module` token for compressed metadata). [ERROR]
    *   If nested, `ResolutionScope` must be a `TypeRef`. [ERROR]
    *   No duplicate rows based on `ResolutionScope`, `TypeName`, `TypeNamespace`. [ERROR]

*   **Purpose:** Defines types (classes, interfaces, value types, enums) within the current module.
*   **Columns:**
    1.  **`Flags` (4-byte bitmask `TypeAttributes`):** Attributes of the type (visibility, layout, semantics, abstract, sealed, etc.). See §II.23.1.15 for flags. Must have only valid bits set. [ERROR] Visibility must be one of the valid options. [ERROR] Layout must be one of the valid options. [ERROR] etc.
    2.  **`TypeName` (index into #Strings heap):** Name of the type. Must index a non-empty string. [ERROR] Must be a valid CLS identifier [CLS]. Cannot be `<Module>`. [ERROR]

    4.  **`Extends` (coded index `TypeDefOrRef`):** Token (`TypeDef`, `TypeRef`, `TypeSpec`) of the base class or interface this type extends/implements. See §II.23.2.8. Must be null only for `System.Object` and `<Module>`. [ERROR] Must index a valid Class row (not Interface or ValueType), unless this TypeDef is itself an Interface. [ERROR] Base class cannot be sealed. [ERROR] Base class cycles are invalid. [ERROR]
    5.  **`FieldList` (index into `Field` table):** Index of the first field owned by this type. Marks the start of a contiguous run.
    6.  **`MethodList` (index into `MethodDef` table):** Index of the first method owned by this type. Marks the start of a contiguous run.
*   **Validation:**
    *   Row 0 represents the pseudo-type `<Module>` for global fields/methods.
    *   Must be one row for `<Module>`. [ERROR]
    *   Extends must be null for `<Module>`. [ERROR]
    *   No duplicate rows on `TypeName`+`TypeNamespace`, except for nested types. [ERROR]
    *   If nested, must have exactly one owner row in `NestedClass` table. [ERROR]
    *   If `Flags.HasSecurity` is set, must own a row in `DeclSecurity` or have `SuppressUnmanagedCodeSecurityAttribute`. [ERROR]
    *   If owns rows in `DeclSecurity`, `Flags.HasSecurity` must be set. [ERROR]
    *   ValueTypes must be sealed. [ERROR] Must have non-zero size. [ERROR] Runtime size < 1MB. [ERROR]
    *   Interfaces must have `Flags.Abstract` = 1. [ERROR] Cannot be sealed. [ERROR] Cannot own instance fields. [ERROR] All owned methods must be abstract. [ERROR]
    *   If Enum, must derive from `System.Enum`, be sealed, have no methods, no interfaces, no properties, no events, static fields must be literal, exactly one instance field of underlying integer type named "value__" marked `RTSpecialName`. [ERROR] [CLS]
    *   See §II.22.37 for many more rules.

**5. Constructing and Modifying Metadata (Hot Reload Considerations)**

The ECMA-335 standard primarily defines the static structure. Modifying metadata at runtime (as needed for hot reload) requires careful consideration:

*   **Heaps (#Strings, #Blob, #US, #GUID):** These are fundamentally append-only. New strings, blobs, signatures, or GUIDs must be added to the end. Existing data cannot typically be overwritten or removed without invalidating existing indices. Indices pointing into these heaps will remain valid if data is only appended.
*   **Tables (`#~` Stream):**
    *   **Adding Rows:** New rows (e.g., new methods, fields, types) are typically appended to the *end* of the relevant table. The `Rows` array in the `#~` header must be updated.
    *   **Updating Rows:** Can be done in place if the row size doesn't change. Care must be taken with fixed-size fields.
    *   **Deleting Rows:** Logically deleting rows is complex and generally not supported directly by the format without significant rewriting/compacting, which invalidates existing tokens. Hot reload often uses mapping tables or marks rows as "deleted" logically.
*   **Metadata Tokens:** Adding rows to a table *invalidates the RIDs* of subsequent rows in that *same* table relative to existing code. Any code holding tokens that reference rows after the insertion point needs to be updated or re-resolved. This is a major challenge for hot reload. Coded indices are also affected if target table row counts change significantly.
*   **Index Sizes:** Appending rows might cause a table to exceed the 2^16 row limit (or 2^(16-tag_bits) for coded indices), forcing a transition from 2-byte to 4-byte indices for *all* columns referencing that table/coded index group. This requires rewriting significant portions of the metadata.
*   **Sorted Tables:** Tables like `InterfaceImpl` and `GenericParamConstraint` require specific sorting. Adding rows requires inserting them in the correct sorted position, which is much harder than simple appending and likely involves rewriting table segments.
*   **Contiguous Runs (`FieldList`, `MethodList`, `ParamList`, etc.):** The metadata relies on fields, methods, and parameters belonging to a type/method forming a contiguous run of rows in their respective tables. Adding members requires careful management of these runs, potentially inserting new rows and updating the list pointers (`FieldList`, `MethodList`) in the parent table (`TypeDef`, `MethodDef`). This might involve shifting existing rows if the new member isn't added at the end of the run.
*   **Deltas:** Implementing hot reload typically involves creating *metadata deltas* – descriptions of the changes (added types, modified methods, etc.) rather than rewriting the entire metadata in place. The runtime then needs a mechanism to merge or overlay these deltas onto the original metadata view.

**6. Conclusion**

Constructing valid CLI metadata requires strict adherence to the table schemas, encoding rules (little-endian, integer compression, coded indices), signature formats, heap structures, index size calculations, and validation rules defined in ECMA-335 Partition II. Implementers must pay close attention to byte-level details, index resolution, and the interdependencies between tables and heaps. Modifying metadata, especially for scenarios like hot reload, introduces significant complexity due to the static, index-based nature of the format and requires careful management of tokens, row counts, index sizes, and table sorting/contiguity rules, often necessitating delta-based approaches rather than in-place modification.
